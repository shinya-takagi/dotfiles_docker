# README

There are dotfiles that I customized among PC, Remote PC and computers in our lab.

# Feture

This repository contains about bash files, zsh files, vim files, and so on.

If you install them at first, run 'dotfileLinks.sh' to generate the links of dotfiles in your home directory.

# Notice
